# Secondary analysis of ITR-seq data

Analysis steps applied to the ITR-seq results generated by the [primary analysis pipeline](https://github.com/Penn-GTP/ITR_Seq2)

## Steps and status

  - Remove on-target site from off-target peak list
  - Merge peaks from multiple libraries (Jared finished script)
  - Re-format peak annotation (Jared to work on a script)
  - Match off-target reference sequences to on-target sequence and PWM (Zhe to finish up script)
  - Filter out mispriming sites (Zhe to work on script)
  - Evaluate negative/positive controls (Strategy to be discussed)
 
## Extra on-demand analysis

  - Compare peak location and frequency in multiple samples
  - Integrative analysis of ITR-seq and Amplicon-seq data
  - Clonal expansion analysis
  - ITR typing and wtAAV analysis
