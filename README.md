# Secondary analysis of ITR-seq data

Analysis steps applied to the ITR-seq results generated by the [primary analysis pipeline](https://github.com/Penn-GTP/ITR_Seq2_public)

## Steps and status

Create a subdirectory called "secondary" in the main directory and save all the files from secondary analysis there. 

  (Required):
  - Remove on-target site from off-target peak list
    - Input: [sample]_ref_peak.bed (bed file generated by the pipeline)
    - Output: [sample]_offtarget_peak.bed
  - Filter out mispriming sites
    - Input: [sample]_offtarget_peak.bed
    - Output: [sample]_offtarget_nomispriming_peak.bed
  - Re-format peak annotation
    - Input: [sample]_offtarget_nomispriming_peak.bed
    - Output: [sample]_offtarget_nomispriming_annotated_peak.csv
  - Match off-target reference sequences to on-target sequence and PWM
    - Input: [sample]_offtarget_nomispriming_annotated_peak.csv
    - Output: [sample]_offtarget_nomispriming_annotated_pwmscored_peak.csv
   
  (Optional)
  - Merge peaks from multiple libraries
  - Evaluate negative/positive controls (Strategy to be discussed)
 
## Extra on-demand analysis

  - Compare peak location and frequency in multiple samples
  - Integrative analysis of ITR-seq and Amplicon-seq data
  - Clonal expansion analysis
  - ITR typing and wtAAV analysis
